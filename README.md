# Algorithmic Toolbox

In this repo, I share some exercises and my assignments for coursera's course "Algorithmic Toolbox".
They're enough for passing all the assignments to get the certificate.

## Usage

If you're taking this course right now, feel free to clone this repo and checkout the exercises and assignments for your reference.
I think this course is quite useful for people who don't have cs background but are interested in basic understanding of algorithm. 

## Contributing

Some of them are not refactored yet.
Feel free to folk, create a new branch and submit a pull request if you think there's a better way:p
